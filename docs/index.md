## Summarry of the Project:

- [Github Repository](https://github.com/Chilly712/CrossTheFireLine_Minecraft)

We are using reinforcement learning to train the agent learn how to dodge a fireball and avoid the fireblocks on the ground. Both the agent and the monster will be limited to a space with a glowing wall, sea lantern.
The monster will launch fireballs towards the agent's location, and the agent will need to learn how to dodge the fireballs from the monster and the fire blocks formed on the ground.
The information provided by the environmental, ghast and agents will be converted into np.arrays that continue to be understood and transmitted into the reinforcement learning model.
